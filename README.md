# **Admin-dashboard**

## This is the final project of the Intermediate HTML/CSS section of The Odin Project

In this project, I've built a Admin Dashboard template using plain HTML and CSS using grid and flexbox.

### **Difficulties I've encountered:**
- I took a while to figure out why my grid layout was overlapping the box shadow of the navbar.
- I used some Font Awesome icons and SVG, which gave me problems when aligning these with the text nex to them.
- At last, my main problem in this project was the main section of the dashboard, which I thought it would be the easiest. The problem was in how to implement the grid, which thankfully it was the only big problem in this project.
